We have developed an interactive user interface for our application through which users can play away their boredom hours.<br>

## Features and Games:
Once the Splash Screen loads up with Fuse Logo , we enter the home page of the application. We have to enter a username /gamertag (or leave it as blank and you will be registered as an anonymous player). On clicking the play icon, we enter the game catalogue, where the gamer can choose which game he wishes to play. Highscores of the users in the respectively games will be maintained along with the username / gamertag. We can go to the home screen of the application, on clicking highscore logo, it will take you to the Scoreboard of various gamers and their highscores in different games.
